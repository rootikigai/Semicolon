Question 6: rotate image.

you are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees(clockwise).


example 1:

input: nums = [
	[1, 2, 3],
	[4, 5, 6],
	[7, 8, 9]
	]
output: [
	[7, 4, 1],
	[8, 5, 2],
	[9, 6, 3],
	]



Question 7:

write a method that counts the number of occurences of a specified character in a given string.

example 1:

input: word = "Hello World" letter = "o"
output: 2

example 2:

input: word = "OpenAI" letter = "a"
output: 1

example 3:

input: word = "Java" letter = "k"
output: 0



Question 8:

write a method that finds the smallest index of the largest element in an array. if the array has multiple occurences of the largest element, the method should return the index of the first occurence.

example 1:

input: {1, 5, 3, 4, 5, 5}
output: 1

example 2:

input: {1, 2, 8, 20, 5}
output: 3



Question 9:

write a method that takes two unsorted lists and returns a new sorted list in descending order.

example 1:

input 1: [3, 1, 5] input 2: [8, 6, 4]
output: [8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 1]

example 2:

input 1: [7, 4, 1] input 2: [9, 3, 2]
output: [9, 7, 4, 3, 2, 1]



Question 10:

write a method which takes in an integer and returns the factors of the number.

example 1:

input: 7
output: [1, 7]

example 2:

input: 24
output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24]
